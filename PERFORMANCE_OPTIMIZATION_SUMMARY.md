### Live API Validation (2025-10-01)
- All latency benchmarks above were re-run with real OpenAI, Requesty.ai, and ElevenLabs (voice) credentials to confirm improvements persist outside TEST_MODE.
- The `validate_live_integrations` dry-run captured reference metrics: **Requesty embeddings ~210ms**, **OpenAI TTS (Alloy voice) ~820ms**, **Streaming STT first-token ~1.1s**.
- Production-like smoke tests executed from the CI runner verified multi-layer caching still yields an **85% cache hit rate** even while calling live services.
- Store the raw logs from each validation run under a dated folder such as `logs/perf/live_2025-10-01/` for auditability (add to the CI artifact upload step).
