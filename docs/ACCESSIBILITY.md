# Accessibility Guidelines

## Planning Assistant UI Accessibility

### Current Status (Phase 3)

The Streamlit planning suite has been designed with basic accessibility in mind:

#### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Semantic Status Indicators**
   - Color-coded status badges with emoji icons
   - Text labels accompany all color indicators
   - Multiple visual cues for status (color + icon + text)

2. **Descriptive Labels**
   - All form inputs have clear labels
   - Button text describes actions clearly
   - Expanders have descriptive titles

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Clear heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
   - Logical content flow
   - Consistent spacing and grouping

4. **Error Messaging**
   - Clear error messages via `st.error()`
   - Toast notifications with icons and text
   - Helpful guidance for failed operations

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Streamlit's built-in responsive layouts
   - Column-based layouts adapt to screen width
   - Mobile-friendly by default (with Streamlit limitations)

#### ⏳ Recommended Future Improvements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab order optimization
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Focus indicators enhancement
   - Skip-to-content links

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements
   - ARIA live regions for dynamic updates
   - ARIA descriptions for complex widgets
   - Role attributes for custom components

3. **Color Contrast**
   - Audit all color combinations
   - Ensure WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 ratio)
   - Provide high-contrast theme option

4. **Voice Control**
   - Voice command support for actions
   - Audio feedback for operations
   - Text-to-speech for assistant responses

5. **Text Alternatives**
   - Alt text for any visual-only indicators
   - Transcripts for voice content
   - Captions for any future video content

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with NVDA/JAWS screen readers
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios
- [ ] Test with browser zoom (200%+)
- [ ] Verify with mobile devices
- [ ] Test with voice control (Dragon, Voice Access)

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Color Independence**
   - Never rely on color alone
   - Always provide text + icon + color

2. **Clear Action Labels**
   - "Approve Plan" not just "Approve"
   - "Refresh Conversation" not just "Refresh"
   - Descriptive button text

3. **User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for actions
   - Loading spinners for async operations
   - Success/error confirmations

4. **Predictable Behavior**
   - Consistent UI patterns
   - Standard interaction paradigms
   - Clear navigation structure

### Streamlit Limitations

Streamlit has some inherent accessibility limitations:

1. **Limited ARIA Support**
   - Cannot easily add ARIA attributes
   - Custom HTML required for advanced features

2. **Fixed Component Behavior**
   - Standard components may not be fully accessible
   - Limited customization options

3. **Dynamic Updates**
   - Rerun behavior can be disruptive
   - Screen reader announcements need careful handling

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Use clear, descriptive text everywhere
2. Provide multiple sensory cues (visual + text + icon)
3. Maintain consistent UI patterns
4. Test with accessibility tools
5. Consider custom HTML components for critical interactions

### Future Work

For production deployment, consider:
1. Full accessibility audit by specialist
2. User testing with assistive technology users
3. Custom accessible components for complex interactions
4. Compliance certification if required
