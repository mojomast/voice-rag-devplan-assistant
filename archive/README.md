## Why These Files Were Archived

These files served their purpose during earlier phases but are no longer the primary reference for ongoing development. They contain:

- **Outdated status information** — Phases 1-3 are complete
- **Historical progress tracking** — Superseded by Phase 4 tracking
- **Legacy roadmaps** — Current work defined in `nextphase.md`

They are preserved here for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding project evolution
- Audit trail of decision-making
- Learning from past approaches

---

## Accessing Archived Files

These files are still readable and can be referenced if you need to understand:
- How earlier phases were implemented
- What decisions were made and why
- Evolution of the project architecture
- Historical context for current features

**Note:** Do not update files in this archive. All active development should reference and update files in the project root and `docs/` directory.
