# Phase 4: Testing & Validation Guide

**Status:** Ready for Testing  
**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Prerequisites:** All implementation complete (Steps 1-9)

---

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive testing plan to validate Phase 4 RAG integration functionality before marking the phase complete.

---

## Pre-Test Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure backend is running
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Verify Requesty API key is set
# In .env:
# ROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 2. Database State

```bash
# Check if you have test data
sqlite3 data/devplanning.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM devplans;"
sqlite3 data/devplanning.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;"
```

**If no data exists**, create sample projects and plans through the UI first.

### 3. Vector Store Initialization

```bash
# Run bulk re-indexing (dry run first)
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --dry-run

# If looks good, run actual indexing
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all

# Expected output:
# ============================================================
# Re-indexing Complete
# ============================================================
# Plans:         X/X indexed (0 failed)
# Projects:      X/X indexed (0 failed)
# Conversations: X/X indexed (0 failed)
# ============================================================
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Create a new development plan with multiple sections
2. Check logs for indexing confirmation
3. Verify vector store files exist

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check vector store was created
ls -la vector_store/devplans/

# Should see:
# index.faiss
# index.pkl
```

**Success Criteria:**

2. Start a planning conversation
3. Check if similar projects are suggested

**Backend Test:**
```python
# In Python console or test script
from backend.project_memory import ProjectMemorySystem
from backend.database import get_async_session_context
from backend.storage.project_store import ProjectStore
from backend.storage.plan_store import DevPlanStore
from backend.storage.conversation_store import ConversationStore
from backend.rag_handler import RAGHandler

async def test_memory():
    async with get_async_session_context() as session:
        memory = ProjectMemorySystem(
            project_store=ProjectStore(session),
            plan_store=DevPlanStore(session),
            conversation_store=ConversationStore(session),
            rag_handler=RAGHandler()
        )
        
        # Replace with actual project ID
        context = await memory.get_project_context("project-id-here")
        print(f"Similar projects: {len(context['similar_projects'])}")
        print(f"Key decisions: {len(context['key_decisions'])}")
        print(f"Lessons learned: {len(context['lessons_learned'])}")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_memory())
```

**Success Criteria:**

2. **Update Plan:**
   - Edit an existing plan (change title or status)
   - Check logs for re-indexing message

3. **Delete Plan:**
   - Delete a test plan
   - Check logs for "Removed plan X from vector index"

**Log Monitoring:**
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -i "index"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] New plans trigger `on_plan_created`
- [ ] Updates trigger `on_plan_updated`
- [ ] Deletes trigger `on_plan_deleted`
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Vector store stays in sync

2. Ask: "Design an authentication system"
3. Observe if agent references similar past work

**Expected Behavior:**
- Agent should mention similar plans if they exist
- Context should include project history
- Suggestions should be relevant

**Manual Check:**
Review the agent's response for phrases like:
- "Based on similar projects..."
- "In past work, we found..."
- "Related plans show..."

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent uses enriched context
- [ ] Mentions similar past work
- [ ] Provides relevant suggestions
- [ ] No context errors in logs
