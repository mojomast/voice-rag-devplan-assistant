---

## ✅ Completed Work

### Step 1: DevPlan Processor ✅
**File:** `backend/devplan_processor.py`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Markdown parsing with section chunking (max 1200 chars)
- ✅ Embedding generation via Requesty `embedding-001` model
- ✅ FAISS vector store integration
- ✅ Metadata extraction (project_id, status, tags, version)
- ✅ Document ID generation for updates/deletions
- ✅ Chunk-level and full-document indexing

**Key Features:**
- Handles plans with multiple markdown sections
- Preserves section hierarchy and order
- Supports incremental updates (removes old, adds new)
- Returns detailed indexing statistics

---

### Step 2: Project Memory System ✅
**File:** `backend/project_memory.py`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `get_project_context()` - comprehensive project info retrieval
- ✅ `find_similar_projects()` - RAG-powered similarity search
- ✅ `_extract_key_decisions()` - mines plan history for decisions
- ✅ `_extract_lessons()` - extracts lessons from conversation summaries
- ✅ Integrated with `PlanningContextManager`

**Key Features:**
- Aggregates data from projects, plans, conversations
- Semantic search across vector stores
- Context enrichment for planning agent
- Returns structured memory payload

---

### Step 3: Auto-Indexer Updates ✅
**File:** `backend/auto_indexer.py`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Instantiates `DevPlanProcessor` and `ProjectIndexer`
- ✅ `on_plan_created()` - indexes new plans
- ✅ `on_plan_updated()` - re-indexes modified plans
- ✅ `on_plan_deleted()` - removes from vector store
- ✅ `on_project_created/updated()` - indexes project metadata
- ✅ `on_conversation_ended()` - indexes conversation summaries
- ✅ RAG handler reload notifications

**Integration:**
- ✅ Called from `backend/routers/devplans.py` on CRUD operations
- ✅ Called from `backend/routers/projects.py` on project changes
- ✅ Runs indexing in background threads (async)

---

### Step 4: Enhanced Planning Agent Context ✅
**Files:** `backend/context_manager.py`, `backend/planning_agent.py`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ `PlanningContextManager` uses `ProjectMemorySystem`
- ✅ `build_context()` includes semantic search results
- ✅ Similar projects retrieved via RAG
- ✅ Key decisions and lessons included in prompts
- ✅ Planning agent receives RAG-enhanced context

**Key Features:**
- Automatic context enrichment on every planning query
- Semantic search results included as suggestions
- Project memory provides historical context
- Context serialized as prompt sections

---

### Step 5: Search API Endpoints ✅
**File:** `backend/routers/search.py` (NEW)

**Implementation:**
```
POST   /search/plans                    # Semantic plan search
POST   /search/projects                 # Semantic project search
GET    /search/related-plans/{plan_id}  # Find related plans
GET    /search/similar-projects/{id}    # Find similar projects
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Request/response models with Pydantic validation
- ✅ Metadata filtering (project_id, status, tags)
- ✅ Score-based ranking
- ✅ Content previews (300 chars)
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Registered in `backend/main.py`

**API Examples:**
```python
# Search plans
POST /search/plans
{
  "query": "authentication implementation",
  "project_id": "proj-123",
  "status": ["in_progress", "completed"],
  "limit": 10
}

# Find related plans
GET /search/related-plans/plan-456?limit=5
```

---

### Step 7: Bulk Re-indexing Script ✅
**File:** `backend/scripts/reindex_all.py` (NEW)

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Batch processing with progress bars (tqdm)
- ✅ Separate functions for plans, projects, conversations
- ✅ Dry-run mode for testing
- ✅ Detailed statistics tracking
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Configurable batch size

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry run to preview
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --dry-run

# Index only plans
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --plans-only

# Full re-index with custom batch size
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --batch-size 20

# Force re-index everything
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --force
```

**Output:**
```
============================================================
Re-indexing Complete
============================================================
Plans:         42/45 indexed (3 failed)
Projects:      12/12 indexed (0 failed)
Conversations: 8/10 indexed (2 failed)
============================================================
```

## ✨ Frontend Enhancements Delivered

### Step 6: Related Projects UI Component ✅
**File:** `frontend/pages/project_browser.py`

**Highlights:**
- Streamlit sidebar now surfaces "🔗 Related Projects" expander with similarity percentages.
- `_fetch_related_projects` wraps `/search/similar-projects/{project_id}` including limit parameter and error handling.
- Session state wiring lets users jump directly to related projects; toast notifications confirm actions.

**Verification:**
- Manual review confirms similarity scores, metadata chips, and navigation buttons work as expected (2025-09-30).

---

### Step 8: Search UI in Planning Chat ✅
**File:** `frontend/pages/planning_chat.py`

**Highlights:**
- Sidebar search form posts to `/search/plans` with current project scoping and limit controls.
- Results display score percentages, status metadata, preview snippets, and CTA buttons.
- "Use as Context" automatically stages a follow-up message; "View Full Plan" loads plan payload into session state cache.

**Verification:**
- Smoke-tested query flow in TEST_MODE; telemetry logging records search events (2025-09-30).

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### 1. Verify Backend is Working
```bash
# Start backend (ensures backend package is on PYTHONPATH)
cd C:\Users\kyle\projects\noteagent\voice-rag-system
$env:PYTHONPATH="$PWD"; ..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Test search endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/search/plans \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test", "limit": 5}'
```

### 2. Run Re-indexing (if needed)
```bash
# Dry run first
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all --dry-run

# Then live
python -m backend.scripts.reindex_all
```

### 3. Finish Phase 4 validation
- Run `python test_phase4.py` once the backend is live
- Capture results in this file and update doc statuses to 100%
- Double-check README + roadmap reflect final completion

## 📝 Notes for Next Developer

### Key Context
1. **All backend infrastructure is complete** - focus on frontend/docs/tests
2. **Auto-indexing works automatically** - plans indexed on create/update
3. **RAG handler is lazy-loaded** - initialized on first use
4. **Vector stores use Requesty embeddings** - `requesty/embedding-001`
5. **FAISS is the vector store** - local storage, no external service needed

### Common Issues
1. **Vector store not found**: Run re-indexing script first
2. **Embedding errors**: Check Requesty API key in `.env`
3. **Import errors**: Ensure running from project root
4. **TEST_MODE enabled**: Set real API keys to disable

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check database contents
sqlite3 data/devplanning.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM devplans;"

# View vector store files
ls -la vector_store/devplans/

# Test search endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/search/plans \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"test","limit":3}' | jq
```
